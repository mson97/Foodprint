# Foodprint

Foodprint is an app that addresses the sustainability issue of water usage in the products we consume. By scanning the barcode attached to the price tag of grocery store items, the app displays how much water it takes to provide the produce.

Foodprint involves a built-in water grading systemâ€”these indicate roughly how many liters of water went into the production of a specific product. We inform customers of how much hidden water is in what they buy, which in turn encourages them to compare across brands and choose a water-wiser option. By simply presenting facts to our audience, we can tackle the issue of water over-consumption through the small step of awareness.
